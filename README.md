# dnaWriterA

A variant of the dnaWriter (https://github.com/lurbano/dnaWriter) that hews a little closer to the standard amino acid naming letters (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables#Inverse_DNA_codon_table)

To change the codon table you just need to make changes to the *dna_writer.js* file.
